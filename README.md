Whenever I read books to learn code I like to separate out the content from each chapter into its own folder. I use the command line on Mac to mkdir for each chapter, then hit code . to open that chapter from the command line, but this quickly became very repetitive.

folder_creator.py prompts an input to create a folder in your Documents folder and create a folder for the number of chapters you need. 

If you use this code, you will need to change parent_dir path to the location you want the newDir to fall. I typically create the newDir as the title of the book I am reading. For instance, Automate the boring stuff, I entered newDir = "automate". 

I was really happy with this for two reasons. First, it is a simple script that saves time in just a few lines. Second, I was able to identify a repetitive task and use a For loop to solve for a problem. 

Hope you like it!
